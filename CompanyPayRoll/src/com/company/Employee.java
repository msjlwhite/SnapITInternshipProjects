Task: Company Payroll App -- Create a fake company
-Give company 3 different Employees (manager, cashier, accountant)
-Use Employee as an abstract class
-All employees will have String name, int employeeId, double salary
-Manager is full-time employee, cashier is part-time, accountant is contract
-As a user, I want the ability to add, update, and delete employees to the fake company, calculate each employee's salary and income taxes.
-Use your own discretion on each employees hourly rate which, along with income taxes, will determine their salary
-Create a design based on these requirements (doesn't have to be super detailed), create a Trello ticket ("Employee Design - <your name>"), and post them there
-Ask any questions you might have!
