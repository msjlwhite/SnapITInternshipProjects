Task: Create a fake company
-Give company 2 different Employees (manager, cashier)
-Use Employee as an abstract class
-Employees will share String name, int employeeId fields
-Manager is a salaried employee, cashier is an hourly employee
-As a user, I want the ability to calculate each employee's weekly pay

*HINT:*
-The user is asked to input the number of hours the cashier worked, then weekly pay is calculated.
-The hours worked per week is irrelevant for a salaried employee, who is always paid the same amount.

-Each class should have a constructor and a weeklyPay method. Only the abstract Employee class will have getters/setters
-Create a design based on these requirements (doesn't have to be super detailed), create a Trello ticket ("Employee Design - <your name>"), and post them there
-Ask any questions you might have!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Scanner flow should be something like this:*
**If Cashier**
Employee name:
Employee Id:
Employee Type:
Hourly Rate:
Hours Worked:
(Upon hitting enter, this should display employee's info *see attached screenshot)

**If Manager**
Employee name:
Employee Id:
Employee Type:
Annual Salary:
(Upon hitting enter, this should display employee's info *see attached screenshot)
