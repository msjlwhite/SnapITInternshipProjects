Task: Company Payroll App -- Create a fake company
-Give company 3 different Employees (manager, cashier, accountant)
-Use Employee as an abstract class
-All employees will have String name, int employeeId, double salary
-Manager is full-time employee, cashier is part-time, accountant is contract
-As a user, I want the ability to add, update, and delete employees to the fake company, calculate each employee's salary and income taxes.
-Use your own discretion on each employees hourly rate which, along with income taxes, will determine their salary
-Create a design based on these requirements (doesn't have to be super detailed), create a Trello ticket ("Employee Design - <your name>"), and post them there
-Ask any questions you might have!

*Scanner flow should be something like this:*
**If Cashier**
Employee name:
Employee Id:
Employee Type:
Hourly Rate:
Hours Worked:
(Upon hitting enter, this should display employee's info *see attached screenshot)

**If Manager**
Employee name:
Employee Id:
Employee Type:
Annual Salary:
(Upon hitting enter, this should display employee's info *see attached screenshot)
